# Balance

Balance is an open-source, offline-first personal finance app built with React Native and Expo. It keeps every wallet, transaction, and insight on your device while still offering a polished native experience.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/openMoney-v1.git
cd openMoney-v1
npm ci
npx expo start
```

- Scan the QR code with Expo Go (iOS/Android) to preview.
- Run `APP_VARIANT=free|pro npm run <script>` or `npx eas build -p ios --profile freeStore` to target each variant with the proper limits.

## Contribution

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change and include tests if needed.
3. Open a PR with a concise summary.

We care about clean TypeScript, privacy, and offline readiness. Thanks for improving Balance!
